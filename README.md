# Graphing-Calculator
## Features:
        
### Implemented: 
        -> Linked List Functions 
        -> List Class 
        -> Stack and Queue Class 
        -> Token Class (Base/Parent Class) 
        -> Number, Variable, Function, Lparen, Rparen and Operator Class (Derived/Child Class) 
        -> RPN Class 
        -> Shunting Yard Class 
        -> Transform Class (polar, screen coords, and shifts) 
        -> Evaluate Class
        -> System Class 
        -> Animate Class (also has Sidebar for saving and loading files).

### GUI:
       - Press Z: to zoom in
       - Press M: to zoom out
       - Press W: to increase points
       - Press P: to decrease points
       - Press Up, Down, Left, and Right Arrow: to shift graph
       - Press V: for regular graph
       - Press B: for Polar graph
       - Press J: for cool graph
       - TextEnter: for typing expression on screen
       
       I have throw statement in my previous_node, stack pop, queue, pop, RPN, and
       Shunting Yard. It gets caught in Evalute Class, which throws the type again
       and any type is caught in animte update (specifically for system step).
       The graph keeps the interval, coordinate of the mouse, and number of points
       updated everytime.
                     
### Bugs: 
       features that are implemented are bug-free.
    
### Reflections:
       The Graphing Calculator project made myself become creative and take challenges to graph
       different graphs, such as polar. This required me to use projects from the past (lower-level)
       such as Linked List Functions, List Class, and Stack and Queue Class, in order to slowly build
       higher-level classes. Plus, use SFML in order to create a visual graph and different buttons.
